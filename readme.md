# Challenge Project

## Setup

Install dependancies with NPM and Bower.

`npm install` and `bower install`

## Run

There is a grunt task to start the app.

`grunt serve`

Saving is simulated and logs the to be saved data to the console. There is a commented out example call to the API endpoint, but as the API doesn't exist, it won't actually work. Try uncommenting to see the error.
